**Lane Detection:**

The Lane detection project, is initially focussed on implementing a conventional lane detection with C++.
Here, I have used opencv V4.5.2 which was latest at the time of my download.

Base implementation involved setting up the environment with the necessary libraries and basic implementation of opening an image file using opencv package. This is achieved by using the `Mat` variable of opencv package along with `imread()` and `imshow()` inbuilt functions of opencv package.

In case of Windows, declare the paths with `\\` - double back slasles.
